make_spiral.cpp is a path planner I wrote for a larger DARC lab project. The other software for the project belongs to other people and is thus not uploaded here.  prm.py was part of a motion planning class assignment. The PriorityQ and SearchNode classes were provided to us by the professor, but the rest is my own work.
